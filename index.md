## Grading

The grade will count the assessments using the following proportions (tentative and subject to change):
* __40%__ of your grade will be determined by homework:
  * We will have 8 short homework assignments roughly covering each main topic in the class 
  * Each assignment take __5%__ of the final grade.
* __25%__ of your grade will be determined by the class project.
  * __5%__ of your grade will be determined by the project proposal.
  * __5%__ of your grade will be determined by the intermediate report.
  * __5%__ of your grade will be determined by the project poster presentation.
  * __10%__ of your grade will be determined by the project final report.
* __10%__ of your grade will be determined by the paper presentation. 
* __10%__ of your grade will be determined by Mid-term Exam.
* __10%__ of your grade will be determined by Final Exam.
* __5%__ of your grade will be determined by your participation. Students who finish the class project, peer reviews, and all assignments/exams will receive the full credits of participation.
